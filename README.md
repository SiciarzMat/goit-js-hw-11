## General info
This is a search engine for images. Users can search them based on phrases entered.
First search gives only 40 results. To get more than that user has to click "Load more". In the future, I'm planning to add "infinite scroll" mode and change the design.

Working on this application helped me to learn about HTTP Protocol, HTTP methods and requests, async/await syntax and IntersectionObserver.
